# Hand Gesture Controlled Math Problem Solver

This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that allows users to solve math problems using hand gestures captured through a webcam. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect hand gestures and interacts with a generative AI model to provide solutions to math problems.

# Features

Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition: The system detects hand gestures in real-time using the OpenCV library.\
Interactive Canvas: Users can draw on a canvas using their hand gestures to input mathematical expressions.\
AI-Powered Math Problem Solver: Utilizes a generative AI model to interpret the mathematical expressions drawn by the user and provides solutions.\
Simple User Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

# Requirements

Python 3.x\
OpenCV\
cvzone\
Streamlit\
Google GenerativeAI
